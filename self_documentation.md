### Self-Study Documentation

This documentation outlines the key areas I studied while working on my tasks, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. It serves as a reference for future work and a guide for dealing with common issues that may arise during development.

### 1. **Understanding File Permissions and Ownership in Linux**

#### **Topics Studied**:
   - **Linux File Permissions (`rwx`)**: How to control read, write, and execute permissions for users, groups, and others.
   - **Chmod and Permission Levels**: Different permission levels like `755` (owner can read/write/execute, others can read/execute) and `777` (full access to everyone).

#### **Challenges**:
   - **Permission Denied Error**: While trying to run scripts or install software, I encountered the **Permission Denied** error multiple times. Initially, this was due to inadequate permissions assigned to certain files or directories.
   
#### **Solution**:
   - **Using `chmod` Command**: I used the `chmod 777` command to grant full permissions to files and directories, resolving the issue. Initially, I was using `chmod 755`, which didn't provide sufficient access. 
   
     - `sudo chmod 777 <filename>`: This command provided read, write, and execute permissions to all users.

#### **Takeaway**:
   - Granting full access (`777`) works in development environments but is risky in production due to security vulnerabilities. Learning to apply the principle of least privilege (`chmod 755` or lower) is essential for production environments.

### 2. **Using `sudo` to Manage Elevated Permissions**

#### **Topics Studied**:
   - **Difference Between `sudo` and Root**: I learned how `sudo` allows me to execute commands with root privileges temporarily.
   - **The `sudoers` File**: Explored how to manage users with sudo privileges through the `sudoers` configuration.

### 4. **Understanding Linux File Management Commands**

#### **Topics Studied**:
   - **Basic Linux Commands**: `ls`, `cd`, `mv`, `cp`, and `rm` for navigating and managing the file system.
   - **Directory and File Ownership**: How to use `chown` to change file ownership and `chgrp` to assign groups.

#### **Challenges**:
   - **File or Directory Not Found**: Occasionally, I would try to move or access a file and get a "file not found" error because of incorrect paths or typos.

#### **Solution**:
   - **Using Absolute File Paths**: By switching to absolute paths (e.g., `/home/user/project/file.js`), I minimized these errors.
   - **Checking File Existence**: Using `ls` to verify the file or directory exists before trying to access or move it.

#### **Takeaway**:
   - Ensure proper file paths are used and double-check for typos or incorrect file names to avoid unnecessary errors.
